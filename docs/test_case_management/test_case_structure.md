# Test Case Structure

This section explains how the test case structure is modeled within the application, focusing on the key entities, their relationships, and how to interact with them to manage test cases effectively.

## Overview of Test Case Components

The core of test case management involves several interconnected entities that collectively define, organize, and track testing activities. These components include:

- **Test Cases**: The fundamental unit representing individual test scenarios.
- **Test Suites**: Collections of related test cases grouped logically.
- **Test Plans**: Higher-level groupings that encompass multiple test suites and define testing objectives.
- **Test Runs**: Executions of test cases against specific configurations or versions.
- **Test Steps**: Sequential actions within a test case.
- **Test Results**: Outcomes of test executions, including status, defects, and comments.
- **Attachments**: Files or screenshots linked to test cases or results.

## Key Entities and Their Roles

### Test Case (`TestCase`)
- Represents a single test scenario with attributes like title, description, preconditions, and expected results.
- Can be linked to multiple test steps and attachments.
- Supports versioning and history tracking.

### Test Suite (`TestSuite`)
- Groups related test cases.
- Supports hierarchical nesting for complex test structures.
- Facilitates bulk operations like copying or moving test cases.

### Test Plan (`TestPlan`)
- Defines overarching testing objectives.
- Contains references to multiple test suites.
- Tracks progress and overall status.

### Test Run (`TestRun`)
- Executes a set of test cases within a specific context (environment, configuration).
- Records execution status, start/end times, and results.
- Supports re-running failed or specific test cases.

### Test Step (`TestStep`)
- Details individual actions within a test case.
- Includes step description, expected outcome, and actual result.

### Test Result (`TestResult`)
- Captures the outcome of a test case execution.
- Includes status (pass, fail, blocked), comments, defect links, and attachments.

### Attachments (`Attachment`)
- Files linked to test cases, steps, or results.
- Can include screenshots, logs, or other relevant documents.

## How to Understand and Manage Test Cases

### Viewing Test Case Structure
1. Navigate to the **Test Cases** section.
2. Use the hierarchical tree to explore test suites and nested test cases.
3. Select a test case to view details, steps, attachments, and history.

### Creating a New Test Case
1. Click on **Add Test Case** within a suite.
2. Fill in the title, description, preconditions, and expected results.
3. Add individual test steps with descriptions and expected outcomes.
4. Save the test case, which will be linked to the current suite.

### Organizing Test Cases
- Use the **Test Suite** hierarchy to group related test cases.
- Drag and drop test cases between suites if supported.
- Copy or move test cases to different suites for reuse.

### Executing Test Cases
1. Select a test case or suite.
2. Initiate a **Test Run**.
3. For each test step:
   - Perform the action described.
   - Record the actual result.
   - Mark the step as pass, fail, or blocked.
4. Save the test run results, which update the overall status.

### Analyzing Test Results
- View the **Test Run** report to see pass/fail statistics.
- Drill down into individual test results for detailed comments and attachments.
- Link defects or issues directly from test results for traceability.

### Managing Attachments
- Upload screenshots or logs directly within test case or result views.
- View or download attachments as needed for analysis or reporting.

## Implementation Details
- The test case structure is modeled via entities with properties such as `Title`, `Description`, `Preconditions`, `ExpectedResults`, and relationships to steps, attachments, and history.
- Hierarchical relationships are managed via parent-child links in test suites and nested test cases.
- Versioning and history tracking are supported through change logs and audit entities.
- The data schema employs foreign keys, indexes, and cascade rules to maintain integrity and performance.

## Summary
Understanding the test case structure involves recognizing the relationships between test cases, suites, plans, executions, and results. Managing this structure effectively allows for organized, traceable, and efficient testing workflows, supporting both manual and automated testing strategies within the platform.
