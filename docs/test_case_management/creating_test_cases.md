# Creating Test Cases

This section provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for creating effective test cases within the test management platform. It covers the essential steps from initial planning to documenting detailed test steps, ensuring clarity, traceability, and thorough coverage.

## Step 1: Understand the Test Case Requirements

- **Identify the feature or functionality** to be tested.
- Review **acceptance criteria** and **business requirements**.
- Determine **preconditions** necessary for the test.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Test Case Creation Module

- Log into the test management platform.
- Access the **Test Cases** section from the main menu.
- Click on the **Create New Test Case** button, usually labeled as **Add Test Case** or similar.

## Step 3: Fill in Basic Test Case Details

- **Test Case Name**: Provide a clear, descriptive title indicating the purpose.
- **Test Suite/Category**: Assign the test case to an appropriate suite or category.
- **Test Priority**: Set priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- **Test Type**: Specify if itâ€™s functional, regression, smoke, etc.
- **Test Data**: Mention any specific data required for execution.

## Step 4: Define Preconditions and Preconditions Details

- Specify any setup steps or data needed before executing the test.
- For example: "User must be logged in," or "Test environment must be configured with version X."

## Step 5: Document Test Steps

- **Step-by-step instructions**:
  - Clearly describe each action to perform.
  - Use concise, unambiguous language.
  - Include expected results after each step.
- **Example**:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the login page.
  - Step 2: Enter valid username and password.
  - Step 3: Click on the **Login** button.
  - Expected Result: User is redirected to the dashboard.

- **Tip**: Use numbered lists for clarity and consistency.

## Step 6: Specify Expected Results

- For each step, clearly state what the expected outcome is.
- This helps testers verify whether the step passes or fails.
- Example: "The dashboard loads successfully with user-specific data."

## Step 7: Attach Supporting Files (Optional)

- Upload relevant documents, screenshots, or test data files.
- Use the **Attach Files** option to include images of UI, logs, or configuration files.

## Step 8: Add Additional Details (Optional)

- **Test Data**: Specify input values.
- **Postconditions**: Describe the state after test execution.
- **Notes/Comments**: Include any additional instructions or considerations.

## Step 9: Save and Review

- Click **Save** or **Create** to finalize the test case.
- Review the created test case for completeness and clarity.
- Make edits if necessary to improve understanding.

## Step 10: Execute and Record Results

- When executing the test case:
  - Follow each step precisely.
  - Record actual results.
  - Mark each step as **Pass** or **Fail**.
  - Attach evidence if available (screenshots, logs).

## Tips for Creating Effective Test Cases

- Keep steps simple and focused.
- Use consistent terminology.
- Write from the perspective of the tester.
- Cover both positive and negative scenarios.
- Ensure traceability to requirements.

By following this structured approach, you ensure that your test cases are comprehensive, clear, and effective in validating the application's functionality.
