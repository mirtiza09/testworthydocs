# Bulk Operations

This section provides detailed instructions on how to perform bulk operations on multiple test cases within the test management platform. These operations include selecting multiple test cases and executing actions such as editing, deleting, moving, or updating properties collectively. Follow the step-by-step guide below to efficiently manage bulk test case actions.

## Step 1: Navigating to the Test Cases List

1. Log into the test management platform.
2. Navigate to the **Test Cases** section via the main menu or dashboard.
3. Locate the list or grid view displaying all test cases associated with a specific project or suite.

## Step 2: Selecting Multiple Test Cases

1. To select multiple test cases, do one of the following:
   - **Using checkboxes:**
     - Locate the checkbox column at the start of each test case row.
     - Click on individual checkboxes to select specific test cases.
     - To select all visible test cases, click the checkbox in the header row (often labeled "Select All").
   - **Using Shift+Click for range selection:**
     - Click the checkbox of the first test case.
     - Hold down the **Shift** key.
     - Click the checkbox of the last test case in the desired range.
     - All test cases in between will be selected automatically.
2. Confirm that the desired test cases are highlighted or checked.

**Tip:** Some interfaces may support multi-select via drag or keyboard shortcuts; refer to the platform's specific instructions if available.

## Step 3: Initiating Bulk Operations

1. Once multiple test cases are selected, locate the **Bulk Actions** menu or toolbar button, typically labeled as **Actions**, **Bulk Edit**, or similar.
2. Click on this menu/button to reveal available bulk operations.

## Step 4: Choosing the Desired Action

Available bulk actions may include:

- **Edit Properties:** Change status, priority, assigned user, or other properties for all selected test cases.
- **Delete:** Remove multiple test cases at once.
- **Move:** Transfer test cases to another suite or folder.
- **Clone:** Duplicate selected test cases.
- **Change Status:** Mark all selected test cases as Passed, Failed, or other statuses.
- **Assign to User:** Batch assign selected test cases to a specific user.

1. Select the desired bulk action from the menu.
2. Confirm any prompts or dialog boxes that appear, specifying details such as target suite, new status, or property values.

## Step 5: Applying the Bulk Operation

1. After configuring the bulk action parameters, click **Apply** or **Confirm**.
2. Wait for the operation to complete; progress indicators or notifications will inform you of success or failure.
3. Review the updated test cases to ensure the bulk operation was executed correctly.

## Additional Tips

- **Filtering:** Use filters to narrow down the list to specific test cases before bulk selection, ensuring precise actions.
- **Undo:** If available, utilize undo options or check the activity log to revert unintended bulk changes.
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform bulk operations on test cases.
- **Batch Size:** Be mindful of platform limitations on batch sizes; perform bulk actions in manageable groups if needed.

## Summary

Performing bulk operations on test cases involves selecting multiple items via checkboxes or range selection, choosing an appropriate action from the bulk menu, configuring necessary parameters, and confirming the operation. This process streamlines test management tasks, saving time and maintaining consistency across multiple test cases.

**Remember:** Always review the changes after applying bulk actions to verify correctness and avoid unintended modifications.
