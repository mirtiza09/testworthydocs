# Security

## Data Security

TestWorthy employs multiple layers of security to protect your data. All sensitive information, such as user credentials and personal data, is stored securely with encryption at rest and in transit. The system enforces strict access controls, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific data based on their roles and permissions. Data is validated on both client and server sides to prevent injection attacks and unauthorized modifications. Regular security audits and updates are performed to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

## Access Control

Managing access to TestWorthy features and data is achieved through a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system. Users are assigned roles such as Administrator, Tester, Project Manager, or Guest, each with defined permissions. These permissions govern what features and data each role can access or modify. Access rights are enforced at the API and UI levels, ensuring users can only perform actions permitted by their roles. Administrators can create, modify, or revoke roles and permissions via the admin interface, allowing flexible and granular control over system access.

## Encryption

TestWorthy ensures data confidentiality through encryption mechanisms. All data transmitted between clients and servers is secured using HTTPS with TLS encryption. Sensitive data stored in databases, such as passwords, are hashed with strong algorithms like bcrypt or PBKDF2, including salting to prevent rainbow table attacks. Additionally, any stored API keys, tokens, or secrets are encrypted using environment-specific encryption keys. For external integrations, secure token management practices are followed, and secrets are stored in protected configuration files or secret management systems.

## Compliance

TestWorthy adheres to relevant regulatory standards to ensure data privacy and security. It complies with GDPR for handling personal data of users in applicable regions, including user consent, data access, and deletion rights. For organizations subject to industry-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA, ISO 27001), additional controls and audits are implemented. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are conducted to maintain compliance and identify potential security gaps. Audit logs are maintained for sensitive operations, supporting accountability and traceability.

## Security Best Practices

- Use strong, unique passwords for all user accounts and enforce multi-factor authentication where possible.
- Regularly update and patch all software components, including dependencies and server environments.
- Limit user permissions to the minimum necessary for their roles.
- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest.
- Monitor system logs for suspicious activity and set up alerts for potential security incidents.
- Educate users about security awareness, including phishing and safe password practices.
- Backup data regularly and verify the integrity of backups.
- Implement session timeouts and automatic logout for inactive users.
- Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- Conduct periodic security reviews and penetration tests to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities proactively.
