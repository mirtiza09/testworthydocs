# Encryption

This section explains how data encryption is handled within the TestWorthy platform, focusing on the mechanisms, components, and best practices for securing sensitive information.

## Overview

TestWorthy employs encryption techniques to protect sensitive data such as user credentials, configuration details, and other confidential information stored within the system. The encryption process ensures data confidentiality both at rest and during transmission, adhering to industry standards and best practices.

## Core Components

### Encryption Utility Class

- **Purpose:** Provides methods for encrypting and decrypting data using symmetric encryption algorithms.
- **Main Methods:**
  - `Encrypt(string plainText)`: Accepts plain text input and returns an encrypted string.
  - `Decrypt(string cipherText)`: Accepts encrypted text and returns the decrypted plain text.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Utilizes AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption.
  - Uses a secret key and initialization vector (IV) stored securely in configuration files or environment variables.
  - Ensures key rotation policies are in place for maintaining security.

### Key Management

- **Secure Storage:** Encryption keys are stored securely, often in environment variables or dedicated key vaults.
- **Rotation Policy:** Keys are rotated periodically to reduce the risk of compromise.
- **Access Control:** Only authorized components or services can access encryption keys.

### Data Handling

- **Encryption at Rest:** Sensitive data stored in the database or file storage is encrypted using the utility class before saving.
- **Encryption in Transit:** Data transmitted over the network (e.g., API calls, web requests) is secured via TLS (Transport Layer Security).
- **Decryption:** When data is retrieved, it is decrypted using the utility class before being processed or displayed.

## Usage Instructions

### Encrypting Data

1. Instantiate the encryption utility class:

```csharp
var encryptor = new EncryptionHelper();
```

2. Encrypt sensitive data before saving:

```csharp
string plainText = "Sensitive information";
string encryptedText = encryptor.Encrypt(plainText);
```

3. Store the encrypted text in the database or configuration.

### Decrypting Data

1. Retrieve the encrypted data from storage.

2. Decrypt when needed:

```csharp
string decryptedText = encryptor.Decrypt(encryptedText);
```

3. Use the decrypted data within the application securely.

## Best Practices

- **Key Security:** Keep encryption keys confidential and restrict access.
- **Secure Storage:** Use secure vaults or environment variables for key storage.
- **Regular Rotation:** Rotate encryption keys periodically and update dependent components.
- **Audit and Logging:** Log encryption/decryption activities for audit purposes, avoiding logging sensitive data.
- **Compliance:** Follow relevant standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS as applicable.

## Additional Considerations

- **Performance:** Encryption and decryption can impact performance; optimize by caching decrypted data if appropriate.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure encryption algorithms are compatible across all environments and platforms used.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for encryption failures to prevent data loss or corruption.

## Summary

TestWorthy's data encryption strategy relies on a dedicated utility class implementing AES encryption, combined with secure key management and adherence to best practices. Proper implementation ensures that sensitive data remains confidential, secure from unauthorized access, and compliant with security standards. Developers should utilize the provided encryption methods whenever handling sensitive information within the system, maintaining strict control over encryption keys and following security protocols.
