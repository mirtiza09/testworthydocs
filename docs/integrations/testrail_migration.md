# TestRail Migration

This section provides guidance on how to utilize tools and processes for migrating test data from TestRail to TestWorthy. It covers the necessary steps, configurations, and considerations to ensure a smooth transition of test cases, plans, runs, and related artifacts.

## Overview

Migrating from TestRail to TestWorthy involves exporting your existing test data from TestRail and importing it into TestWorthy's database or API endpoints. The process can be manual or automated, depending on your setup, and may include data transformation to match TestWorthy's schema.

## Prerequisites

- Access to your TestRail instance with export permissions.
- Administrative access to TestWorthy's database or API.
- Familiarity with CSV, JSON, or XML formats used for data export/import.
- Backup of current TestWorthy data to prevent data loss during migration.
- Optional: Migration scripts or tools provided by TestWorthy or third-party solutions.

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

### 1. Export Data from TestRail

- Log into your TestRail instance.
- Navigate to the desired test suites, test cases, test runs, or plans.
- Use the built-in export feature:
  - For test cases, select the suite or project and choose **Export > CSV** or **XML**.
  - For test runs and plans, export relevant data similarly.
- Save the exported files locally, ensuring data completeness.

### 2. Prepare Data for Import

- Review exported files for completeness and consistency.
- Transform data if necessary:
  - Map TestRail fields to TestWorthy schema.
  - Convert CSV/XML to JSON if required by your import scripts.
  - Clean data to remove duplicates or invalid entries.
- Use provided data transformation scripts or write custom scripts to match the schema.

### 3. Import Data into TestWorthy

- Access TestWorthy's import interface or API:
  - Use REST API endpoints if available.
  - Use database import scripts if direct database access is permitted.
- For API-based import:
  - Authenticate using API keys or OAuth tokens.
  - Upload test cases, plans, runs, and attachments via POST requests.
- For database import:
  - Use SQL scripts or tools like SQL Server Management Studio, ensuring data matches schema constraints.
- Validate import success:
  - Check for errors or warnings.
  - Confirm data appears correctly in TestWorthy.

### 4. Verify and Validate

- Cross-reference a sample of imported test cases and test runs.
- Run test queries or reports to ensure data integrity.
- Address any discrepancies or missing data.

### 5. Post-Migration Cleanup

- Remove or archive old TestRail data if no longer needed.
- Update links, references, or integrations to point to the new data.
- Inform stakeholders of the migration completion.

## Important Considerations

- **Data Mapping**: Ensure all relevant fields (test case IDs, titles, steps, expected results, statuses) are correctly mapped.
- **Attachments and Comments**: Export and import associated attachments, comments, and history if supported.
- **Test Data Consistency**: Maintain consistency in test statuses, priorities, and custom fields.
- **Automation**: For large datasets, consider scripting the import process using TestWorthy's API.
- **Backup**: Always backup current data before starting migration.

## Additional Resources

- TestRail Export Documentation
- TestWorthy API Documentation
- Custom Migration Scripts (if provided by TestWorthy support)
- Community Forums and Support Channels

## Tips

- Perform a trial migration with a subset of data.
- Validate data thoroughly before going live.
- Document your migration steps for future reference.
- Coordinate with your QA and development teams to minimize downtime.

By following these steps, you can efficiently migrate your test data from TestRail to TestWorthy, ensuring continuity and data integrity throughout the process.
