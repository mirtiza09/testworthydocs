# Administration

This section provides detailed instructions on managing tenant configurations, handling backups, optimizing performance, routine maintenance, and system audit logs within the application. Follow these step-by-step guides to perform each task effectively.

## Tenant Management

### Tenant Settings

To configure tenant-specific settings:

1. Log in as an administrator with tenant management privileges.
2. Navigate to the Tenant Management section from the admin dashboard.

4. Access the Tenant Settings page.
5. Adjust configurations such as:
   - Default language
   - Time zone
   - Notification preferences
   - Custom fields or labels
6. Save changes to apply the new settings.

### Subscription Management

To handle subscription details and billing:

1. From the admin panel, go to the Subscription Management area.
2. Select the tenant whose subscription you want to review or modify.
3. View current subscription plan, billing cycle, and payment history.
4. To update subscription:

   - Confirm changes and trigger billing updates.
5. For billing issues:
   - Access the billing history.
   - Generate invoices or receipts.
   - Contact support for payment disputes.

### Usage Monitoring

To track tenant usage metrics:

1. Access the Usage Monitoring dashboard.
2. Select the tenant for which you want to view metrics.
3. Review data such as:
   - Number of active users
   - Test executions
   - Storage consumption
   - API calls
4. Set alerts or thresholds for usage limits.
5. Export reports for analysis if needed.

## Backup and Restore

### Backing Up Data

1. Schedule regular backups via the admin panel or database management tools.
2. Use the provided backup procedures:
   - Export the database via SQL Server Management Studio or command-line tools.
   - Save backup files securely in off-site storage.
3. Verify backup integrity periodically.

### Restoring Data

1. Prepare the target environment with the same database schema.
2. Import the backup file:
   - Use SQL Server Management Studio or command-line tools.
3. Confirm data consistency and integrity.
4. Test the restored environment thoroughly before resuming operations.

## Performance Tuning

To optimize application performance:

1. Monitor system metrics via the admin dashboard.
2. Identify bottlenecks:
   - Slow queries
   - High CPU or memory usage
   - Network latency
3. Apply optimizations:
   - Index frequently queried columns.
   - Archive old data.
   - Optimize database schema.
   - Enable caching where appropriate.
4. Review application logs for errors or warnings.
5. Adjust server resources as needed.

## Maintenance Tasks

Routine maintenance includes:

1. Applying software updates and patches.
2. Clearing temporary files and logs.
3. Validating database integrity.
4. Checking for orphaned or inconsistent data.
5. Updating third-party dependencies.
6. Performing security audits and vulnerability scans.
7. Documenting maintenance activities.

## Audit Logs

To view and analyze system audit logs:

1. Navigate to the Audit Logs section from the admin menu.
2. Filter logs by date, user, or event type.
3. Review logs for:
   - User login/logout
   - Data modifications
   - Configuration changes
   - Security events
4. Export logs for external analysis.
5. Set up alerts for suspicious activities.

**Tip:** Regularly review audit logs to ensure compliance and detect unauthorized activities.

This completes the guide for managing tenant configurations, backups, performance, maintenance, and audit logs within the system. Follow these steps to maintain a secure, efficient, and compliant environment.
