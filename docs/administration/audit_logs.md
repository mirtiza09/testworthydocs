# Audit Logs

This section explains how to access, view, and analyze system audit logs within the application. Audit logs are essential for tracking user activities, system events, and changes made across the platform, providing transparency and security oversight.

## Accessing Audit Logs

1. **Navigate to the Audit Logs Section:**
   - Log in to the application with appropriate permissions.
   - From the main menu or dashboard, locate the **Administration** or **System Settings** area.
   - Look for a menu item labeled **Audit Logs** or similar.

2. **Open the Audit Logs Page:**
   - Click on the **Audit Logs** link to open the logs view.
   - The page will display a list of audit entries with filtering options.

## Viewing Audit Log Entries

1. **Filter Logs:**
   - Use available filters to narrow down the logs:
     - **Date Range:** Select start and end dates to view logs within a specific period.
     - **User:** Filter by specific user accounts to see their activities.
     - **Event Type:** Choose types such as login, data change, permission updates, etc.
     - **Entity:** Filter by affected entities like projects, test cases, users, etc.

2. **Search and Sort:**
   - Use the search box to find specific entries by keywords.
   - Click on column headers (e.g., Date, User, Event) to sort logs ascending or descending.

3. **View Log Details:**
   - Click on individual log entries to view detailed information.
   - The details may include:
     - Timestamp of the event
     - User who performed the action
     - Action performed
     - Entity affected
     - IP address or device info
     - Additional metadata or comments

## Analyzing Audit Data

1. **Identify Patterns:**
   - Use filters and sorting to identify suspicious activities or unusual patterns.
   - Look for multiple failed login attempts, permission changes, or data modifications outside normal hours.

2. **Export Logs:**
   - If available, export logs for further analysis:
     - Click on the **Export** button.
     - Choose formats such as CSV, Excel, or PDF.
     - Save the file locally for offline review or reporting.

3. **Generate Reports:**
   - Use built-in reporting tools or export data to create custom audit reports.
   - Summarize activities over specific periods or by user groups.

## Implementation Details

- The audit logs are stored in dedicated database tables, typically capturing event details, timestamps, user info, and affected entities.
- The logs are retrieved via server-side queries with filtering parameters passed from the UI.
- The logs view supports pagination for large datasets.
- Security measures ensure only authorized users can access audit logs, preventing unauthorized data exposure.

## Tips for Effective Log Analysis

- Regularly review logs to detect unauthorized access or system misuse.
- Set up alerts for critical events like failed login attempts or permission escalations.
- Maintain logs for a sufficient retention period based on compliance requirements.
- Use filters strategically to focus on relevant timeframes or activities.

By following these steps, developers and administrators can efficiently access and analyze audit logs to monitor system activity, ensure security compliance, and troubleshoot issues.
