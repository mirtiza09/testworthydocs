# Filtering and Searching

This section explains how to find specific test cases within test suites and sections in the application. It details the user interface interactions, filtering options, and search functionalities available to efficiently locate test cases based on various criteria.

## Accessing the Test Cases Search Functionality

1. **Navigate to the Test Suites or Sections Page**  
   - From the main dashboard, select the relevant project.  
   - Locate the "Test Suites" or "Sections" tab in the sidebar or top menu.  
   - Click on the desired suite or section to view its test cases.

2. **Open the Search or Filter Panel**  
   - Look for a search bar or filter icon typically positioned above the test case list or in the toolbar.  
   - Click on the filter icon or focus on the search input box to activate filtering options.

## Filtering Test Cases Step-by-Step

1. **Select Filter Criteria**  
   - Use dropdown menus or checkboxes to filter by:
     - **Status** (e.g., Passed, Failed, Blocked)  
     - **Priority** (e.g., High, Medium, Low)  
     - **Type** (e.g., Functional, Regression)  
     - **Assigned User** (e.g., specific tester or team member)  
     - **Milestone** (e.g., specific release or sprint)  
   - For multi-criteria filtering, select multiple options as needed.

2. **Apply Filters**  
   - After selecting the desired criteria, click the **Apply** button or press Enter to filter the list.  
   - The test case list dynamically updates to show only the matching entries.

3. **Clear Filters**  
   - To reset the filters, click the **Clear** button or deselect all criteria, then reapply or refresh the list.

## Searching for Specific Test Cases

1. **Use the Search Box**  
   - Enter keywords such as test case ID, title, or description into the search input field.  
   - The list filters in real-time or upon pressing Enter, showing only test cases matching the search term.

2. **Advanced Search Options**  
   - Some interfaces offer an **Advanced Search** modal or panel.  
   - Click on the **Advanced Search** button to specify multiple search parameters simultaneously, such as date ranges, tags, or custom fields.

3. **Search by Tags or Custom Fields**  
   - If available, select tags or fill in custom field values to narrow down results further.

## Using the Search and Filter Together

- Combine filtering criteria with the search box for precise results.  
- For example, filter by **Status: Failed** and search for **Login** to find failed login test cases related to login functionality.

## Additional Tips

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Tab and Enter keys to navigate filter options and search fields efficiently.  
- **Saving Filters**: If the application supports it, save frequently used filter combinations for quick access later.  
- **Exporting Results**: Use export options to download filtered test cases as CSV or Excel files for offline review.

## Summary

- Access the test case list via the relevant suite or section.  
- Use the filter panel to select criteria like status, priority, or assigned user.  
- Apply filters to narrow down the list.  
- Use the search box for keyword-based filtering.  
- Combine filters and search for maximum efficiency.

This step-by-step approach ensures quick and accurate retrieval of specific test cases within large test suites and sections, streamlining test management and review processes.
