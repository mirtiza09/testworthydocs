# Managing Sections

This guide explains how to create, organize, and manage sections within test suites in your testing platform. It covers the process of adding new sections, editing existing ones, and structuring your test cases effectively.

## Creating a New Section

To add a new section to a test suite:

1. **Navigate to the Test Suite**  
   - Log into your testing platform.  
   - Locate and open the specific test suite where you want to add a section.

2. **Access the Sections Tab**  
   - Within the test suite view, find the **Sections** tab or panel.  
   - This is typically located in the sidebar or as part of the suite details.

3. **Click on 'Add Section'**  
   - Look for an **Add Section** button or icon (usually a plus sign or labeled button).  
   - Click on it to initiate the creation process.

4. **Enter Section Details**  
   - Provide a name for your section (e.g., "Login Tests", "API Validation").  
   - Optionally, add a description or notes to clarify the purpose of the section.

5. **Save the Section**  
   - Confirm by clicking **Save** or **Create**.  
   - The new section will now appear under the suite's hierarchy.

## Organizing Sections

Once sections are created, you can organize them:

- **Reordering Sections**  
  - Drag and drop sections to reorder them within the suite.  
  - This helps prioritize or group related test cases.

- **Nested Sections**  
  - Some platforms support nested (child) sections.  
  - To create a sub-section, select an existing section and choose **Add Sub-Section**.  
  - Fill in the details and save.

- **Renaming or Editing Sections**  
  - Click on a section name to open its settings.  
  - Modify the name or description as needed.  
  - Save changes to update the hierarchy.

- **Deleting a Section**  
  - Select the section, then choose **Delete**.  
  - Confirm the deletion; note that this may remove all contained test cases unless moved or archived.

## Managing Test Cases within Sections

- **Adding Test Cases**  
  - Open a section and click **Add Test Case**.  
  - Fill in the test case details, steps, expected results, and assign tags or labels.

- **Moving Test Cases**  
  - Drag test cases between sections to reorganize your test plan.

- **Bulk Operations**  
  - Select multiple test cases for bulk move, delete, or status updates.

## Tips for Effective Section Management

- Use descriptive section names to clearly categorize your test cases.  
- Maintain a logical hierarchy to facilitate easy navigation and reporting.  
- Regularly review and update sections to reflect changes in your testing scope.  
- Leverage nested sections for complex test plans requiring detailed grouping.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create and organize sections within your test suites, ensuring a structured and manageable testing process.
