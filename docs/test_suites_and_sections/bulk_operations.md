# Bulk Operations

This section explains how to perform bulk operations on test suites or sections within the application. Bulk operations allow you to efficiently manage multiple test suites or sections simultaneously, such as deleting, moving, or updating properties for multiple items at once.

## Accessing Bulk Operations

1. **Navigate to the Test Suites or Sections Page**
   - Log in to the application.
   - From the main dashboard, select the project or module containing the test suites or sections.
   - Locate the list or tree view of test suites or sections.

2. **Select Multiple Items**
   - To select multiple test suites or sections:
     - Use the checkboxes next to each item.
     - For bulk selection:
       - Click the checkbox of individual items to select them.
       - To select all items at once, click the "Select All" checkbox at the top of the list or tree view.
   - Alternatively, if supported, use shift-click:
     - Click the first item.
     - Hold the Shift key.
     - Click the last item to select the range.

## Performing Bulk Actions

Once multiple items are selected, the bulk operation options become available.

### Step-by-step instructions:

1. **Open the Bulk Operations Menu**
   - Look for a toolbar or a dropdown labeled "Bulk Actions" or similar.
   - Click on it to reveal available options.

2. **Choose the Desired Action**
   - Common bulk actions include:
     - Delete selected suites/sections.
     - Move or copy to another parent or folder.
     - Update properties (e.g., status, priority).
     - Export selected items.
   - Select the action you want to perform.

3. **Configure Action Details (if applicable)**
   - For actions like move or update properties:
     - A dialog or sidebar may appear.
     - Specify the target parent, new properties, or other parameters.
   - Confirm your selections.

4. **Execute the Action**
   - Click the "Apply" or "Confirm" button.
   - The system will process the bulk operation.

5. **Review the Results**
   - Wait for the operation to complete.
   - The interface may display success or error messages.
   - The selected items will reflect the changes.

## Important Tips

- **Undo/Cancel**: Some bulk actions may have an undo option or require confirmation before execution.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform bulk operations.
- **Selection Accuracy**: Double-check your selected items before applying bulk actions to avoid unintended changes.
- **Batch Size**: For large selections, the system may process in batches; be patient if it takes time.

## Additional Notes

- Bulk operations are designed to improve efficiency but should be used carefully.
- Some actions may be irreversible; review your selections and intended changes before confirming.
- The interface may disable bulk actions if no items are selected or if the selected items do not support the chosen operation.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage multiple test suites or sections simultaneously, streamlining your testing workflows and maintaining organized test structures.
