# Test Suites and Sections

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions for creating, managing, and performing bulk operations on test suites and sections within the test management platform. It covers organizing test cases into suites, creating and organizing sections within those suites, moving or copying test cases between suites and sections, filtering and searching for specific test cases, and performing bulk actions efficiently.

## Creating Test Suites

To organize your test cases effectively, you need to create test suites that group related test cases together.

### How to create a new test suite:

1. Log in to the test management platform.
2. Navigate to the **Test Suites** section from the main menu.
3. Click on the **Add New Suite** button, usually labeled as "Create Suite" or "+ New Suite."
4. Fill in the suite details:
   - Enter a descriptive **Name** for the suite.
   - Optionally, add a **Description** to specify the suite's purpose.
   - Set any relevant tags or labels if available.
5. Click **Save** or **Create** to add the suite.

*Tip:* You can organize suites hierarchically if the platform supports nested suites.

## Managing Sections

Sections are subdivisions within test suites that help further categorize test cases.

### How to create and organize sections:

1. Open the desired test suite where you want to add sections.
2. Locate the **Sections** panel or tab within the suite view.
3. Click on **Add Section** or **New Section**.
4. Enter a **Section Name** that describes the subset of test cases.
5. Optionally, add a description or tags.
6. Save the section.
7. Drag and drop test cases into sections to organize them logically.

*Tip:* You can reorder sections by dragging them up or down within the suite.

## Moving and Copying Test Cases

To reorganize test cases across suites or sections:

### How to move test cases:

1. In the test case list, select one or multiple test cases (via checkboxes or multi-select).
2. Click on the **Move** button.
3. Choose the target suite and section from the dropdowns.
4. Confirm the move action.

### How to copy test cases:

1. Select the test cases you want to duplicate.
2. Click on the **Copy** button.
3. Select the destination suite and section.
4. Confirm to duplicate the selected test cases in the new location.

*Note:* Moving physically relocates the test cases; copying duplicates them while preserving the original.

## Filtering and Searching

To quickly find specific test cases:

### How to filter/search:

1. Use the **Search** box at the top of the test case list.
2. Enter keywords, tags, or test case IDs.
3. Apply filters such as:
   - Status (Passed, Failed, Blocked)
   - Priority
   - Assigned user
   - Tags or custom fields
4. The list updates dynamically to show matching test cases.

*Tip:* Use advanced filters if available for more granular searches.

## Bulk Operations

Perform actions on multiple test suites, sections, or test cases simultaneously:

### How to perform bulk actions:

1. Select multiple test cases or suites using checkboxes.
2. Once selected, a bulk action menu appears.
3. Choose from options such as:
   - **Bulk Move**: Move all selected test cases to another suite or section.
   - **Bulk Copy**: Duplicate multiple test cases.
   - **Bulk Delete**: Remove multiple test cases at once.
   - **Bulk Update**: Change status, priority, or assigned user for all selected items.
4. Confirm the operation in the prompt.

*Tip:* Use filters to narrow down the selection before bulk operations for efficiency.
