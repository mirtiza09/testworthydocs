   - Note the color coding and order which influence how priorities are displayed in test cases.

## Creating a New Priority

> **Tip:**  
> Priorities linked to existing test cases cannot be deleted unless those test cases are reassigned or deleted first.

## Assigning Priorities to Test Cases

- Adjust the order values to prioritize display as needed.
- The color coding helps visually distinguish test case priorities in dashboards and reports.

## Best Practices

- Define a clear set of priority levels aligned with your testing process.
- Use consistent color schemes for quick recognition.
- Regularly review and update priorities to reflect project needs.

## Summary

Managing test case priorities involves creating, editing, and assigning priority levels to categorize test cases effectively. Proper configuration enhances test planning, execution, and reporting, leading to more efficient quality assurance processes.
