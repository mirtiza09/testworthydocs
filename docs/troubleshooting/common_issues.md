# Common Issues

This section provides step-by-step guidance for resolving frequent problems encountered during the use and development of the application. It covers typical scenarios such as UI component malfunctions, styling inconsistencies, build errors, and integration issues with third-party libraries.

## UI Components Not Displaying Correctly

### Issue:
UI elements such as modals, tooltips, dropdowns, or popovers do not appear or are misplaced.

### Solution:
1. **Check Initialization:**
   - Ensure that the corresponding JavaScript module (e.g., Bootstrap's modal, tooltip, dropdown) has been correctly initialized.
   - Verify that the HTML markup contains the correct data attributes or JavaScript calls.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     $('#myModal').modal('show');
     ```
2. **Verify Dependencies:**
   - Confirm that all required libraries (jQuery, Popper.js, Bootstrap JS) are loaded before your scripts.
   - Check the console for errors related to missing scripts.
3. **Inspect CSS Styles:**
   - Ensure that CSS files for Bootstrap or custom styles are correctly linked.
   - Use browser developer tools to verify computed styles and positioning.
4. **Check Z-Index and Positioning:**
   - If components are hidden behind other elements, adjust `z-index` via CSS.
   - Example:
     ```css
     .modal {
       z-index: 1050; /* Bootstrap default */
     }
     ```
5. **Event Binding:**
   - Confirm that event handlers are bound after DOM is ready.
   - Use:
     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function() {
       // your code
     });
     ```

## Styling Issues or Inconsistent Appearance

### Issue:
Styles are not applied as expected, or themes do not reflect changes.

### Solution:
1. **Check CSS Link Order:**
   - Ensure that custom styles are loaded after third-party libraries to override defaults.
2. **Verify Class Names:**
   - Confirm that elements have the correct classes matching your CSS selectors.
3. **Use Developer Tools:**
   - Inspect elements to see which styles are applied or overridden.
   - Look for conflicting rules.
4. **Clear Cache:**
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl + Shift + R) to bypass cached CSS.
5. **Check for CSS Errors:**
   - Validate your CSS files for syntax errors that might prevent proper parsing.

## Build Errors or Compilation Failures

### Issue:
Errors occur during Gulp build or when compiling SASS/CSS files.

### Solution:
1. **Review Error Messages:**
   - Read the console output carefully to identify the source of errors.
2. **Validate Syntax:**
   - Check for invalid CSS/SASS syntax, such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
3. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
     to ensure all packages are correctly installed.
4. **Check Gulp Tasks:**
   - Verify that your `gulpfile.js` tasks are correctly defined and dependencies are installed.
5. **Resolve Version Conflicts:**
   - If errors relate to incompatible plugin versions, update dependencies in `package.json` and run:
     ```bash
     npm update
     ```

## Third-Party Library Integration Problems

### Issue:
Libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, Chart.js, or Popper.js do not work as expected.

### Solution:
1. **Ensure Correct Loading Order:**
   - Load dependencies in the correct sequence:
     ```html
     <script src="jquery.js"></script>
     <script src="popper.js"></script>
     <script src="bootstrap.js"></script>
     ```
2. **Check Compatibility:**
   - Confirm that library versions are compatible with each other.
   - Refer to official documentation for supported versions.
3. **Verify CDN or Local Paths:**
   - Ensure URLs or file paths are correct and accessible.
4. **Inspect Console for Errors:**
   - Look for 404 errors or JavaScript exceptions.
5. **Test Basic Functionality:**
   - Isolate the library in a minimal HTML page to verify it loads and functions correctly.

## Data Loading or API Issues

### Issue:
AJAX requests fail, or data does not populate charts or tables.

### Solution:
1. **Check Network Requests:**
   - Use browser developer tools to verify request URLs, methods, and responses.
2. **Validate API Endpoints:**
   - Confirm that server endpoints are correct and accessible.
3. **Inspect Response Data:**
   - Ensure data is in expected format (JSON, XML).
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully:**
   - Add error callbacks:
     ```javascript
     $.ajax({
       url: 'api/data',
       method: 'GET',
       success: function(data) { /* process data */ },
       error: function(xhr, status, error) { console.error(error); }
     });
     ```
5. **Cross-Origin Issues:**
   - If CORS errors occur, configure server headers accordingly.

## General Debugging Tips

- Use browser developer tools to inspect DOM, console logs, network activity, and CSS styles.
- Add `console.log()` statements to trace code execution.
- Temporarily disable custom CSS or scripts to isolate issues.
- Validate HTML structure for correctness.
- Check for conflicting scripts or duplicate IDs/classes.

## Summary

Most common issues stem from incorrect initialization, missing dependencies, CSS conflicts, or data errors. Following the above steps systematically will help identify and resolve these problems efficiently. Always verify your environment setup, library versions, and code syntax, and leverage browser developer tools for real-time diagnostics.
