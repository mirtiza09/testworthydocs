# Error Messages

This section provides guidance on common error messages encountered within the application, helping developers identify, interpret, and resolve issues related to the system's components, configurations, and runtime behaviors.

## Understanding Common Error Messages

### 1. Database Connection Errors
- **Message:** "Unable to connect to the database."
- **Cause:** Incorrect connection string, database server offline, or network issues.
- **Resolution:**
  - Verify the connection string in configuration files (`appsettings.json`).
  - Ensure the database server is running and accessible.
  - Check network permissions and firewall settings.
  - Test connection using a database client or command-line tool.

### 2. Migration Failures
- **Message:** "Could not apply migration 'xxxx'."
- **Cause:** Schema conflicts, missing dependencies, or incompatible migration scripts.
- **Resolution:**
  - Review the migration logs for specific errors.
  - Ensure all previous migrations are applied.
  - Use `Update-Database` or `dotnet ef database update` to apply migrations sequentially.
  - Resolve schema conflicts manually if necessary, or revert to a previous migration.

### 3. Entity Framework Core Errors
- **Message:** "The entity type 'XYZ' has no key defined."
- **Cause:** Missing primary key configuration in entity classes.
- **Resolution:**
  - Ensure each entity class has a property marked as `[Key]` or configured via Fluent API.
  - Check migration scripts for primary key creation.
  - Regenerate migrations if schema has changed.

### 4. Missing or Incorrect Configuration
- **Message:** "Configuration value 'XYZ' is missing or invalid."
- **Cause:** Missing environment variables, appsettings entries, or misconfigured options.
- **Resolution:**
  - Verify environment variables and configuration files.
  - Ensure all required settings (e.g., API keys, URLs) are provided.
  - Use logging to trace configuration loading issues.

### 5. API or External Service Failures
- **Message:** "Failed to fetch data from external API."
- **Cause:** Network issues, invalid API keys, or service downtime.
- **Resolution:**
  - Check network connectivity.
  - Verify API credentials and endpoint URLs.
  - Test API access via curl or Postman.
  - Implement retries and error handling in code.

### 6. UI Rendering or Styling Issues
- **Message:** "Elements are misaligned or missing styles."
- **Cause:** CSS conflicts, missing assets, or incorrect class usage.
- **Resolution:**
  - Inspect elements using browser dev tools.
  - Confirm CSS files are loaded correctly.
  - Check class names and HTML structure.
  - Clear cache and rebuild assets if necessary.

### 7. JavaScript Runtime Errors
- **Message:** "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined."
- **Cause:** Accessing properties of null or undefined objects.
- **Resolution:**
  - Use debugging tools to trace variable states.
  - Add null checks before property access.
  - Confirm data is loaded before DOM manipulation.

### 8. Authentication and Authorization Errors
- **Message:** "User does not have permission to access this resource."
- **Cause:** Insufficient roles or missing permissions.
- **Resolution:**
  - Verify user roles and permissions.
  - Check authorization policies.
  - Ensure tokens or session data are valid.
  - Review access control configurations.

### 9. File Upload or Download Errors
- **Message:** "File upload failed" or "Unable to generate download."
- **Cause:** Incorrect file paths, size limits, or server permissions.
- **Resolution:**
  - Check server file system permissions.
  - Verify file size and type restrictions.
  - Inspect network requests for errors.
  - Ensure upload handlers are configured correctly.

### 10. Miscellaneous Errors
- **Message:** "Unexpected error occurred."
- **Cause:** General exceptions, unhandled cases, or bugs.
- **Resolution:**
  - Enable detailed error logging.
  - Use try-catch blocks to isolate issues.
  - Review stack traces for root causes.
  - Test in different environments and browsers.

## Tips for Troubleshooting Effectively
- Always check logs (application logs, database logs, browser console).
- Use breakpoints and debugging tools.
- Reproduce errors in a controlled environment.
- Isolate components to identify the source.
- Consult documentation for third-party libraries.
- Collaborate with team members for complex issues.
