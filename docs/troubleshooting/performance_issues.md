# Performance Issues

This section provides guidance on diagnosing and resolving performance problems within the application. It covers key areas such as identifying bottlenecks, optimizing database queries, improving rendering efficiency, and leveraging caching strategies.

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Monitor Application Performance

- Use browser developer tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools) to analyze network activity, CPU usage, and memory consumption.
- Enable performance profiling to identify slow rendering or scripting bottlenecks.
- Observe the timeline for page load, script execution, and rendering to pinpoint problematic areas.

### 2. Analyze Database Queries

- Review the application's ORM (Entity Framework Core) queries for inefficiencies.
- Enable logging of SQL queries:
  - In your database context configuration, set logging levels to include SQL commands.
  - Use tools like SQL Server Profiler or EF Core logging to monitor executed queries.
- Look for:
  - N+1 query problems (multiple queries for related data).
  - Missing indexes on foreign keys or frequently queried columns.
  - Large data fetches that can be paginated or filtered.

### 3. Optimize Data Access

- Add appropriate indexes to columns involved in filtering, sorting, or joining.
- Use explicit `Include()` statements to eager-load related entities when necessary.
- Avoid fetching unnecessary data; implement server-side filtering and pagination.
- Consider denormalization or caching for read-heavy data that doesn't change frequently.

### 4. Improve Rendering Performance

- Minimize DOM manipulations:
  - Batch updates instead of multiple individual changes.
  - Use document fragments or virtual DOM techniques where applicable.
- Optimize chart rendering:
  - Reduce the number of data points displayed at once.
  - Use simplified series types or aggregation for large datasets.
  - Disable animations or reduce their duration during heavy loads.
- Profile JavaScript execution:
  - Use browser profiling tools to identify long-running scripts.
  - Optimize or defer heavy computations.

### 5. Leverage Caching Strategies

- Implement server-side caching for static or infrequently changing data:
  - Use in-memory caches (e.g., MemoryCache in ASP.NET Core).
  - Cache database query results where appropriate.
- Use client-side caching:
  - Store data in localStorage or IndexedDB for repeated access.
  - Cache chart configurations or data snapshots to reduce server calls.
- Cache rendered images or charts if they do not change often.

### 6. Optimize Asset Loading

- Minify and bundle CSS and JavaScript files:
  - Use tools like Gulp, Webpack, or built-in ASP.NET Core bundling.
- Use CDN for common libraries (jQuery, Bootstrap, Highcharts).
- Lazy-load non-critical assets and scripts.
- Compress images and serve optimized formats.

### 7. Profile and Test

- Use browser performance tools to simulate different network speeds and device capabilities.
- Test with large datasets to evaluate scalability.
- Use server profiling tools (e.g., Application Insights, dotTrace) to identify backend bottlenecks.

### 8. Apply Architectural Improvements

- Consider asynchronous processing for long-running tasks.
- Use background services or queues for intensive operations.
- Scale out resources horizontally if hosting environment supports it.

## Important considerations

- Always test changes in a staging environment before deploying to production.
- Use monitoring tools (Application Insights, New Relic, DataDog) for ongoing performance tracking.
- Regularly review and update indexes and queries as data volume grows.
- Profile both client-side and server-side performance periodically.

## Summary

Diagnosing and resolving performance issues involves a combination of monitoring, query optimization, rendering improvements, caching, and infrastructure scaling. By systematically analyzing each layer—database, server, client rendering, and asset delivery—you can identify bottlenecks and apply targeted optimizations to enhance overall application responsiveness and stability.
