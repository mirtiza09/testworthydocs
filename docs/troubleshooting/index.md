# Troubleshooting

This section provides detailed guidance on resolving common issues, understanding error messages, diagnosing performance problems, and obtaining support for the platform.

## Common Issues

### Issue: Application Fails to Load or Crashes on Startup
- **Symptoms:** Blank screen, error messages in console, or incomplete UI rendering.
- **Solution:**
  1. Verify all JavaScript dependencies are correctly loaded, especially jQuery, Bootstrap, and Highcharts.
  2. Check the browser console for errors related to missing files or syntax errors.
  3. Ensure CSS files are correctly linked and loaded without errors.
  4. Confirm that build steps (if using Gulp) completed successfully and assets are up-to-date.
  5. Clear browser cache or try in incognito mode to avoid stale assets.

### Issue: Charts Not Rendering or Missing Data
- **Symptoms:** Empty charts, axes not displayed, or data points missing.
- **Solution:**
  1. Check that the data passed to Highcharts is correctly formatted and loaded.
  2. Verify that the chart container element exists and has proper dimensions.
  3. Inspect console logs for errors related to data processing or rendering.
  4. Confirm that the correct theme or configuration files are loaded.
  5. Ensure that the browser supports SVG and Canvas features required by Highcharts.

### Issue: UI Components Not Responding or Misaligned
- **Symptoms:** Buttons not clickable, modals not opening, layout issues.
- **Solution:**
  1. Verify Bootstrap CSS and JS files are correctly included.
  2. Check for conflicting CSS styles overriding Bootstrap classes.
  3. Use browser developer tools to inspect element positioning and event listeners.
  4. Confirm that JavaScript event bindings are correctly initialized after DOM load.
  5. Ensure no JavaScript errors prevent execution.

### Issue: Performance Degradation
- **Symptoms:** Slow loading, laggy interactions, high CPU usage.
- **Solution:**
  1. Use browser dev tools to profile JavaScript execution and identify bottlenecks.
  2. Check for large data sets being rendered; consider data aggregation or pagination.
  3. Optimize images and assets; use compressed formats.
  4. Lazy-load components or defer non-critical scripts.
  5. Review custom scripts for inefficient loops or DOM manipulations.

## Error Messages

### Common Error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'xyz' of undefined"
- **Cause:** Attempting to access a property of an object that is not initialized.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Check the console stack trace to identify the source line.
  2. Verify that the data or object is correctly loaded before access.
  3. Add null/undefined checks before property access.
  4. Ensure asynchronous data loads complete before rendering dependent components.

### Common Error: "Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'."
- **Cause:** Passing invalid DOM element or null to `appendChild`.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Confirm the element exists in the DOM.
  2. Check that the element creation code returns a valid node.
  3. Use `console.log()` to verify the object before appending.
  4. Review the sequence of DOM manipulations to ensure proper order.

### Error: "Chart container not found" or "Invalid chart configuration"
- **Cause:** The container element ID/class is incorrect or missing.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Verify the container element exists and has the correct selector.
  2. Ensure the container has explicit width and height.
  3. Check that the chart configuration object is valid and complete.
  4. Confirm scripts are executed after DOM is fully loaded.

## Performance Issues

### Diagnosing Slow Chart Rendering
- Use browser developer tools to profile rendering times.
- Check for large datasets; consider server-side pagination or data reduction.
- Optimize data processing logic in JavaScript.
- Use Highcharts' `turboThreshold` option to limit point rendering.
- Enable WebGL support for large datasets if available.

### Improving UI Responsiveness
- Minimize DOM manipulations during interactions.
- Debounce or throttle event handlers.
- Use CSS hardware acceleration features (`transform`, `will-change`).
- Lazy-load non-critical components or assets.

### Monitoring Memory Usage
- Use browser dev tools to track memory leaks.
- Remove event listeners and DOM nodes when components are destroyed.
- Avoid global variables and unnecessary references.
