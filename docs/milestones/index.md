# Milestones

This section explains how to create, plan, track, and generate reports for milestones within the test management platform. Milestones are key points in testing projects used to monitor progress and organize testing activities.

## Creating Milestones

To set up milestones for tracking testing progress:

1. Navigate to the Milestones section in the platform.
2. Click on the "Add New Milestone" button.
3. Fill in the required details:
   - Name of the milestone.
   - Description (optional).
   - Due date.
   - Associated project or test plan.
4. Save the milestone.
   
*Tip:* You can also import milestones from external sources or previous projects if supported.

## Planning Testing Activities Around Milestones

To align testing activities with milestones:

1. Open the Milestones tab.
2. Select an existing milestone or create a new one.
3. Assign test cases, test runs, or test plans to the milestone:
   - Use the "Assign" or "Link" options.
   - Filter test cases by status, priority, or other attributes.
4. Schedule testing activities:
   - Set start and end dates for associated test cases.
   - Allocate resources or testers.
5. Review the milestone's plan to ensure coverage and timelines.

*Tip:* Use the Gantt or calendar view for visual planning.

## Tracking Progress Towards Milestone Completion

To monitor progress:

1. Go to the Milestones dashboard.
2. Select the milestone you want to track.
3. View progress indicators:
   - Percentage completed based on test cases executed.
   - Number of passed, failed, or blocked tests.
4. Use filters to analyze:
   - Test case status distribution.
   - Resource contributions.
   - Test execution timelines.
5. Update test case statuses as testing proceeds:
   - Mark tests as Passed, Failed, Blocked, or Not Executed.
6. The platform automatically calculates milestone progress based on linked test cases.

*Tip:* Set up notifications or alerts for milestones nearing due dates or with low progress.

## Generating Reports Based on Milestone Data

To produce reports:

1. Navigate to the Reports section.
2. Select "Milestone Report" or similar report type.
3. Choose the specific milestone(s) you wish to report on.
4. Configure report parameters:
   - Date ranges.
   - Test case statuses.
   - Resource contributions.
5. Generate the report:
   - View as HTML or PDF.
   - Export to Excel or CSV for further analysis.
6. Share or schedule report delivery:
   - Send via email.
   - Save as a template for recurring reports.

*Tip:* Use the report filters to analyze bottlenecks, test coverage, or resource utilization.
