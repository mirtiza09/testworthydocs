# Milestone Planning

This section explains how to plan and execute testing activities around milestones within the system. It guides developers through the process of setting up milestone-based testing workflows, managing milestone data, and integrating testing activities with milestone progress.

## Accessing Milestone Planning Features

1. **Navigate to the Milestones Section**
   - Log into the application dashboard.
   - From the main menu, locate and click on the **Milestones** tab.
   - This will display a list of existing milestones or an empty state if none are created.

2. **Create a New Milestone**
   - Click on the **Add Milestone** button.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - **Name**: Enter a descriptive title for the milestone.
     - **Start Date**: Select the start date from the date picker.
     - **End Date**: Select the target completion date.
     - **Description** (optional): Provide additional context.
   - Click **Save** to add the milestone to the list.

## Planning Testing Activities

1. **Associate Test Cases with a Milestone**
   - Select an existing milestone from the list.
   - Click on **Manage Test Cases** or similar action.
   - Use the search or filter options to find relevant test cases.
   - Select test cases to include in this milestone.
   - Confirm the association by clicking **Add** or **Update**.

2. **Schedule Testing Tasks**
   - For each test case linked to the milestone:
     - Define testing schedules, such as start and end dates.
     - Assign responsible testers or teams.
     - Set testing priorities or statuses.
   - Use the **Test Activities** or **Testing Schedule** tab within the milestone details to input this information.

3. **Track Testing Progress**
   - Monitor the status of test cases:
     - Not Started
     - In Progress
     - Completed
   - Update test case statuses as testing progresses.
   - Use progress bars or percentage indicators to visualize overall milestone testing completion.

## Monitoring and Adjusting Testing Activities

1. **Review Milestone Progress**
   - Regularly check the milestone overview dashboard.
   - Observe progress metrics such as:
     - Number of test cases completed vs. planned.
     - Testing activity timelines.
     - Remaining testing workload.

2. **Update Testing Activities**
   - Adjust schedules or test case assignments as needed.
   - Add new test cases or remove outdated ones.
   - Reassess testing priorities based on project needs.

3. **Complete the Milestone**
   - Once all testing activities are finished:
     - Mark the milestone as **Completed**.
     - Record any testing notes or lessons learned.
   - Generate reports or export milestone testing summaries for stakeholder review.

## Best Practices

- **Align Testing with Milestone Dates**: Ensure testing activities are scheduled to meet milestone deadlines.
- **Maintain Flexibility**: Adjust testing plans as project scope or timelines evolve.
- **Document Testing Outcomes**: Record test results, issues, and resolutions within the milestone context.
- **Communicate Regularly**: Keep stakeholders informed about testing progress and any delays.

By following these steps, developers can effectively plan, execute, and monitor testing activities aligned with project milestones, ensuring timely delivery and quality assurance.
