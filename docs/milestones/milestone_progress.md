# Milestone Progress

This section explains how to monitor and track the progress of a milestone within the system. It covers the steps to view, interpret, and utilize milestone progress data effectively.

## Accessing Milestone Progress

1. **Navigate to the Milestones Section:**
   - Log in to the application.
   - From the main menu, select **Milestones**.
   - Locate the specific milestone you want to track.

2. **Open the Milestone Details:**
   - Click on the milestone name or the associated **Details** button.
   - This opens the milestone detail view, which includes progress tracking.

## Viewing Milestone Progress

1. **Locate the Progress Indicator:**
   - Within the milestone detail page, find the **Progress Bar** or **Progress Chart**.
   - The progress indicator visually represents completion status (e.g., percentage completed).

2. **Review Progress Metrics:**
   - Check the numerical progress value, typically displayed as a percentage (e.g., "75% Complete").
   - Some views include additional metrics such as:
     - Number of completed test cases vs. total test cases.
     - Number of completed test runs.
     - Remaining tasks or pending issues.

3. **Analyze Progress Over Time:**
   - If available, review the progress chart showing updates over time.
   - Use this to identify trends, such as acceleration or stagnation in progress.

## Interpreting Progress Data

- **Progress Percentage:**
  - Indicates the proportion of completed work relative to the total scope.
  - 100% signifies full completion.
- **Test Case Completion:**
  - The ratio of executed to total test cases.
  - Helps identify testing coverage and areas needing attention.
- **Test Run Status:**
  - Visual cues (colors, icons) indicate success, failure, or pending statuses.
- **Remaining Tasks:**
  - List or count of incomplete or pending items.

## Utilizing Progress Information

- **Update Stakeholders:**
  - Share progress metrics during meetings or reports.
- **Adjust Plans:**
  - Reallocate resources if progress is behind schedule.
- **Identify Bottlenecks:**
  - Focus on test cases or activities with low completion rates.
- **Set Reminders:**
  - Use progress data to set deadlines for pending tasks.

## Additional Tips

- **Refresh Data Regularly:**
  - Ensure you are viewing the latest progress by refreshing the page or dashboard.
- **Filter by Date or Status:**
  - Use available filters to analyze specific timeframes or test statuses.
- **Export Progress Reports:**
  - If available, export progress data for offline review or presentation.

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor the progress towards milestone completion, enabling proactive management and timely delivery of project goals.
