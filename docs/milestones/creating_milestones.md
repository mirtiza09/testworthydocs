# Creating Milestones

This section explains how to set up and manage milestones within the test management platform to track testing progress effectively. Milestones serve as key checkpoints or deadlines for test phases, releases, or project goals. The process involves creating, configuring, and utilizing milestones to monitor progress and ensure timely delivery.

## Accessing the Milestones Section

1. Log into the test management platform with your user credentials.
2. From the main dashboard, locate the navigation menu on the left sidebar.
3. Click on **"Milestones"** to open the milestones management page.

## Creating a New Milestone

1. On the Milestones page, click the **"Add New Milestone"** button, usually located at the top right corner.
2. Fill in the required fields in the **"Create Milestone"** form:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the milestone (e.g., "Release 1.0 Testing").
   - **Description**: (Optional) Provide additional details about the milestone's purpose.
   - **Start Date**: Select the date when testing for this milestone begins.
   - **End Date**: Choose the target completion date for this milestone.
   - **Priority**: Assign a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to indicate its importance.
3. (Optional) Assign the milestone to specific projects or test suites if your platform supports multi-project management.
4. Click **"Save"** or **"Create"** to finalize the milestone.

## Configuring Milestone Details

1. After creation, select the milestone from the list to view or edit details.
2. Use the edit interface to:
   - Update dates or description.
   - Change priority levels.
   - Link related test cases, test runs, or defects.
3. Save changes to update the milestone configuration.

## Tracking Progress

1. Once milestones are created and assigned, monitor their progress via:
   - Progress bars indicating percentage completion.
   - Lists of associated test cases and their statuses.
   - Reports showing testing status relative to milestone deadlines.
2. Update test case statuses as testing progresses to reflect real-time progress toward the milestone.

## Tips for Effective Milestone Management

- Set realistic start and end dates based on project timelines.
- Regularly review milestone progress during team meetings.
- Use notifications or alerts to remind team members of upcoming milestone deadlines.
- Link relevant defects or issues to milestones for comprehensive tracking.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and utilize milestones to ensure your testing phases stay on schedule and aligned with project goals. Proper milestone management helps identify delays early and facilitates better planning and resource allocation.
