# Bulk Data Operations

This section explains how to execute advanced bulk operations within the test management system, focusing on efficiently managing large datasets such as test cases, test runs, or related entities. These operations enable users to modify multiple items simultaneously, saving time and ensuring consistency across test artifacts.

## Accessing Bulk Operations

1. **Navigate to the relevant test data view:**
   - Log into the application.
   - Go to the **Test Cases**, **Test Runs**, or **Test Suites** section via the main menu.
   - Use filters or search to narrow down the dataset you want to operate on.

2. **Select multiple items:**
   - Use checkboxes next to each item to select individual test cases or test runs.
   - To select all visible items, click the **Select All** checkbox at the top of the list.
   - For partial selections, manually check the desired items.

## Performing Bulk Actions

1. **Open the bulk operations menu:**
   - After selecting items, look for a **Bulk Actions** button or dropdown menu, typically located above or beside the list.
   - Click on it to reveal available bulk operations.

2. **Choose the desired bulk operation:**
   - Common options include:
     - **Change Status**: Update the status of multiple test cases or runs.
     - **Assign to User**: Bulk assign selected items to a specific user.
     - **Update Priority**: Set a new priority level.
     - **Add Labels or Tags**: Tag multiple items for easier filtering.
     - **Move or Copy**: Transfer items between folders or projects.
     - **Delete**: Remove multiple items at once (requires confirmation).

3. **Configure operation parameters:**
   - Depending on the selected action, a modal or inline form appears.
   - Fill in the required fields:
     - For status updates, select the new status from a dropdown.
     - For assignments, choose a user from the list.
     - For tags, enter or select existing tags.
     - For move/copy, select the target folder or project.

4. **Apply the operation:**
   - Review your selections.
   - Click the **Confirm** or **Apply** button.
   - The system processes the bulk update, showing a progress indicator.

## Monitoring and Confirming Changes

- After completion, the system displays a summary:
  - Number of items successfully updated.
  - Any errors or conflicts encountered.
- Refresh the list to see the updated data reflected immediately.

## Important Considerations

- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform bulk operations on the selected entities.
- **Undo/rollback:** Some bulk actions may be irreversible; confirm before applying.
- **Filters:** Use filters to narrow down datasets to avoid unintended bulk modifications.
- **Performance:** For very large datasets, perform bulk operations in manageable batches if the system supports batching to prevent timeouts.

## Tips for Efficient Bulk Operations

- Use **filters and saved views** to target specific subsets of data.
- Combine bulk actions with **search filters** to refine your selection.
- Save frequently used bulk operation configurations as templates for future use.
- Always review the summary report after execution to verify changes.

By following these steps, you can efficiently perform advanced bulk operations, ensuring consistency and saving time when managing large test datasets within the platform.
