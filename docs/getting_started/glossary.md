## Key Terms and Definitions

### TestWorthy
The overarching platform designed for comprehensive test management, including test case creation, execution, reporting, and integrations.

### Test Case
A detailed specification of a particular test scenario, including steps, expected results, and associated metadata. It is the fundamental unit for testing activities.

### Test Run
An execution instance of one or more test cases, capturing the actual results, status, execution time, and related logs.

### Test Plan
A collection of test cases grouped for a specific testing cycle or phase, often associated with milestones or releases.

### Milestone
A significant point or deadline in the project timeline, used to track progress and schedule testing activities.

### Test Suite
A logical grouping of test cases, often representing a feature, module, or component.

### Test Section
A subdivision within a test suite, organizing test cases into manageable segments.

### Test Status
The current state of a test case or test run, such as Passed, Failed, Blocked, or Not Executed.

### Test Data
Input data used during test execution to validate functionality, often stored and managed within test cases.

### Test Environment
The hardware, software, network configurations, and data setup required to execute tests.

### Defect
A reported issue or bug identified during testing, linked to specific test cases or runs.

### User
An individual with access to the platform, assigned roles and permissions to perform testing, reporting, or administrative tasks.

### Role
A set of permissions defining what actions a user can perform within the system, e.g., Tester, QA Lead, Admin.

### Permission
A specific access right, such as view, edit, delete, or manage, assigned to roles and users.

### Project
A container for organizing test cases, test runs, milestones, and related artifacts, representing a software development effort.

### Project Milestone
A target date within a project to achieve specific testing or development goals.

### Attachment
A file linked to test cases, defects, or other entities, such as screenshots, logs, or documents.

### Test Change
A modification or update to a test case, often tracked for version control and audit purposes.

### Test Result
The outcome of a test run, indicating whether the test passed, failed, or was blocked.

### Test Status Log
A record of status changes for test cases or runs over time, useful for tracking progress and history.

### User Management
The process of creating, editing, and assigning roles and permissions to users.

### Dashboard

### Test Automation Framework
A set of tools, libraries, and best practices for automating test execution and reporting.

### Test Coverage
The extent to which test cases cover the application’s features, code, or requirements.

### Defect Lifecycle
The stages a defect goes through, from report, triage, fix, verification, to closure.

### Test Metrics
Quantitative measures such as pass rate, defect density, test execution progress, and coverage.

### Test Environment
The configured hardware/software setup where tests are executed, including configurations, data, and network settings.

### Test Data
Input data used during test execution, which can be static or dynamically generated.

### Test Data Repository
A storage system for test data, often linked to test cases or test runs.

### Test Automation Scripts
Code written to perform automated testing tasks, often integrated with CI/CD pipelines.

### Defect Tracking
The process of recording, managing, and resolving bugs or issues identified during testing.

### Test Management
The overall process of planning, executing, tracking, and reporting testing activities.

### Test Documentation
