# Test Results

This section explains how to record and view test results within the system, focusing on the processes involved in capturing test outcomes and accessing detailed reports.

## Recording Test Results

To record test results, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Test Run or Test Case:**
   - Locate the specific test run or individual test case within the application interface.
   - Use the test suite or project navigation menus to find the relevant test.

2. **Open the Test Result Entry:**
   - Click on the test case or test run to open its details.
   - Look for an option labeled "Record Result" or similar, often represented by a button or icon.

3. **Input Test Outcome Data:**
   - Select the status of the test (e.g., Passed, Failed, Blocked, Retest).
   - Enter additional details such as:
     - Comments or notes explaining the result.
     - Attachments or screenshots if supported.
     - Defect IDs or links to defect reports if applicable.

4. **Save the Result:**
   - Click the "Save" or "Update" button to record the result.
   - Confirm that the status and comments are correctly displayed in the test case or run details.

*Tip:* Some systems allow bulk recording of results for multiple test cases within a test run. Use the bulk update feature if available.

## Viewing Test Results

To view recorded test results and analyze test outcomes:

1. **Access the Test Results Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to the "Test Results" or "Reports" section from the main menu.
   - Select the specific test run, test plan, or milestone to view detailed results.

2. **Filter and Sort Results:**
   - Use filtering options to narrow results by:
     - Status (Passed, Failed, Blocked)
     - Tester or user
     - Date range
     - Test case categories or tags
   - Sort results by execution date, status, or test case name for easier analysis.

3. **Review Individual Test Results:**
   - Click on a specific test case or test run entry to see detailed information.
   - Examine:
     - The recorded status.
     - Comments and notes.
     - Attachments or screenshots.
     - Defect links if linked.

4. **Analyze Summary Reports:**
   - Use summary dashboards or charts to get an overview of testing progress.
   - Look for metrics such as:
     - Total tests executed.
     - Pass/fail ratios.
     - Trends over time.

5. **Export Results (if supported):**
   - Download reports in formats like CSV, XLSX, or PDF for offline analysis or sharing.
   - Use export options typically found in the report or results view.

*Tip:* Many systems support generating detailed test execution reports, including graphs and charts, to visualize test progress and quality metrics.

## Additional Tips

- **Link Results to Defects:**
  - When recording a failed test, link relevant defect IDs to facilitate defect tracking and resolution.

- **Use Comments Effectively:**
  - Provide clear comments explaining the context or issues encountered during testing.

- **Review Historical Data:**
  - Check previous test results to identify regressions or improvements over time.

- **Automate Result Recording:**
  - Integrate with automation tools to automatically update test results based on test execution outputs, if supported.

By following these steps, testers and managers can efficiently record and review test results, ensuring accurate tracking of testing progress and quality assurance metrics.
