# Test Run History

This section explains how to access and interpret the test run history within the application. The goal is to enable users to review past test executions, analyze trends, and troubleshoot issues based on historical data.

## Accessing the Test Run History

1. **Navigate to the Test Runs Section:**
   - Log into the application and locate the main menu.
   - Click on the **Test Runs** tab or menu item.
   - Alternatively, access the specific project or test suite where test runs are recorded.

2. **Open the Test Run History View:**
   - Within the Test Runs page, look for a button or link labeled **History**, **Run History**, or similar.
   - Click on this link to open the historical data view.

## Viewing Test Run Data

Once in the Test Run History page, you'll see a list or table of past test executions with the following typical columns:

- **Test Run ID:** Unique identifier for each test run.
- **Date & Time:** When the test was executed.
- **Status:** Pass, Fail, In Progress, or other custom statuses.
- **Duration:** How long the test took to complete.
- **Test Suite / Test Case:** The specific suite or case associated with the run.
- **Executed By:** User who initiated the test run.
- **Comments/Notes:** Any additional information or annotations.

## Filtering and Sorting

To analyze specific data:

1. **Apply Filters:**
   - Use date pickers or range selectors to filter by execution date.
   - Filter by status (e.g., only failed runs).
   - Filter by user, test suite, or test case.

2. **Sort Data:**
   - Click on column headers to sort ascending or descending.
   - Sort by date to see the most recent runs.
   - Sort by status or duration for performance analysis.

## Viewing Detailed Test Run Results

1. **Select a Test Run:**
   - Click on a row or the test run ID to view detailed results.
   
2. **Review Test Details:**
   - View the list of individual test cases or steps within the run.
   - Check pass/fail status per step.
   - Examine logs, screenshots, or attachments associated with the run.

3. **Analyze Trends:**
   - Use the available charts or graphs (if provided) to see pass/fail trends over time.
   - Identify flaky tests or recurring failures.

## Exporting Data

To share or archive test run data:

1. **Export Options:**
   - Use the export button (often labeled **Export**, **Download**, or similar).
   - Choose formats such as CSV, XLSX, or PDF.

2. **Download Reports:**
   - Save the exported file locally for further analysis or reporting.

## Additional Tips

- **Use Saved Filters:** Save frequently used filter combinations for quick access.
- **Set Alerts:** Configure notifications for specific test run outcomes or failures.
- **Review Attachments:** Download logs, screenshots, or videos linked to specific test runs for troubleshooting.

## Summary

By following these steps, you can efficiently access and analyze your historical test execution data, enabling better insights into test stability, identifying flaky tests, and tracking progress over time. Regular review of test run history is essential for maintaining high-quality software delivery.
