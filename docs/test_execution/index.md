   - Enable or disable specific settings like notifications.
   - Set start and end dates if scheduling.
5. Save the test run to initialize it.

**Tip:** Use the "Clone" feature to duplicate existing test runs for similar testing cycles.

## Assigning Tests

To assign tests to testers:

1. Open the created test run.
2. Navigate to the **Tests** tab within the run.
3. Use the **Add Tests** button to select test cases:
   - Filter by status, suite, or tags.
   - Select individual or multiple tests.
4. Assign each test to a specific tester:

2. Adjust parameters such as:
   - Test execution order (sequential or random).
   - Retry policies.
   - Notification preferences.
   - Data-driven parameters.
3. Save changes to apply.

**Tip:** Use predefined templates for common configurations to streamline setup.

2. Select a test case to execute.
3. Click **Start Test** or **Execute**.
4. Perform the test steps as per the test case instructions.
5. Record the outcome:
   - Pass
   - Fail
   - Blocked
   - Retest
