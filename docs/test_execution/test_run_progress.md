# Test Run Progress

This section explains how to monitor and track the progress of test runs within the system. It covers the key steps and interactions needed to view, analyze, and interpret test run data effectively.

## Accessing Test Run Progress

1. **Navigate to the Test Runs Dashboard:**
   - Log into the application.
   - From the main menu, locate and click on the "Test Runs" section.
   - This will display a list of all test runs associated with your projects.

2. **Select a Specific Test Run:**
   - From the list, click on the desired test run to view detailed progress.
   - Alternatively, use filters or search options to locate a specific run quickly.

## Viewing Test Run Details

3. **Test Run Overview:**
   - On the test run detail page, review the summary including:
     - Total number of test cases executed.
     - Number of passed, failed, blocked, or skipped tests.
     - Start and end times.
     - Duration of the test run.

4. **Progress Indicators:**
   - Observe visual progress bars or pie charts indicating the percentage of tests completed.
   - These visual cues help quickly assess the overall status.

## Analyzing Test Results

5. **Test Case Results:**
   - Expand or click on individual test cases to see detailed results.
   - Review logs, screenshots, or attachments associated with each test case.
   - Check the status (pass/fail/block/skip) for each test case.

6. **Filtering and Sorting:**
   - Use available filters to narrow down results by status, tester, priority, or date.
   - Sort test cases by execution time, status, or other relevant metrics.

## Monitoring Real-Time Progress

7. **Live Updates:**
   - If real-time tracking is enabled, observe live progress updates.
   - Refresh the page or wait for automatic updates to see new test results.

8. **Progress Notifications:**
   - Receive notifications or alerts for test completion or failures if configured.

## Exporting and Sharing Progress Data

9. **Export Reports:**
   - Use export options to generate PDF, Excel, or CSV reports of the test run progress.
   - Share these reports with stakeholders or team members.

10. **Generate Summary Reports:**
    - Access the reporting module to create comprehensive summaries.
    - Include key metrics, charts, and detailed logs.

## Additional Tips

- **Use Dashboards:** Customize dashboards to display multiple test runs and their statuses simultaneously.
- **Set Alerts:** Configure notifications for specific thresholds (e.g., failure rate exceeds 10%).
- **Review Historical Data:** Compare current progress with previous test runs for trend analysis.

By following these steps, you can effectively track and analyze the progress of your test runs, ensuring timely insights and quality assurance.

**Tip:** Regularly monitor the test run progress during execution to identify issues early and take corrective actions promptly.
