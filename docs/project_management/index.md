# Project Management

This section provides detailed instructions on how to create, configure, manage access, utilize templates, understand dashboards, and track history within a project management system integrated into the application.

## Creating Projects

To create and configure a new test project:

1. Log into the application and navigate to the Projects section via the main menu.
2. Click on the "Create New Project" button, typically labeled as "Add Project" or similar.
3. Fill in the project details:
   - Enter a unique project name.
   - Provide a description if required.
   - Select or assign a tenant if multi-tenant support is enabled.
   - Configure project-specific settings such as start/end dates, visibility, and permissions.
4. Save the project:
   - Click the "Save" or "Create" button.
   - The project will be added to the project list.
5. Configure additional settings:
   - Access project settings to set preferences like default test statuses, notification options, or integrations.
   - Assign team members or roles to the project for access control.

## Project Settings

To configure project-specific settings:

1. Open the project from the project list.
2. Navigate to the "Settings" tab within the project.
3. Adjust preferences:
   - Set project visibility (public/private).
   - Define default test statuses, priorities, or custom fields.
   - Enable or disable integrations (e.g., Jira, TestRail).
   - Configure notification preferences.
4. Save changes:
   - Click "Update" or "Save Settings."
   - Changes will be applied immediately and can be modified later as needed.

## Project Access Control

Managing who can access and modify projects involves:

1. Access the project from the project list.
2. Go to the "Access Control" or "Permissions" tab.
3. Add or remove users:
   - Select users from the user list.
   - Assign roles such as Viewer, Editor, Admin.
4. Set granular permissions:
   - Define whether users can view, edit, delete, or manage specific aspects like test cases, configurations, or reports.
5. Save access control settings:
   - Confirm changes to enforce access restrictions.
6. For bulk updates:
   - Use project groups or role mappings to assign permissions to multiple users simultaneously.

## Project Templates

Creating and using project templates allows faster setup:

1. Navigate to the "Templates" section.
2. Click "Create Template."
3. Configure template details:
   - Name the template.
   - Select default settings, test suites, milestones, and configurations to include.
4. Save the template.
5. To create a new project from a template:
   - Select "Create Project" and choose the desired template.
   - Customize project-specific details if needed.
   - Save the new project, which will inherit the template's structure and settings.

## Project Dashboard

Understanding and customizing the project dashboard:

1. Access the project dashboard via the project overview.
2. The dashboard displays:
   - Summary of test cases, runs, milestones, and recent activities.
   - Charts and graphs for project metrics.
   - Quick links to test suites, reports, and settings.
3. To customize:
   - Use the "Customize Dashboard" option.
   - Add or remove widgets.
   - Rearrange components via drag-and-drop.

   - Confirm changes to personalize your project view.
5. Use filters and date ranges to focus on specific data segments.

## Project History

Tracking changes and activities within a project:

1. Open the project and navigate to the "History" or "Activity Log" tab.
2. The activity log displays:
   - Creation, updates, and deletions of test cases, milestones, and configurations.
   - User actions such as permission changes, test runs, or comment additions.
   - Date and time stamps for each activity.
3. Filter activities:
   - Use filters for user, date range, or activity type.
4. Export history:
   - Download logs as CSV or PDF for auditing or reporting purposes.
5. Use this history to monitor project evolution and troubleshoot issues.
