# Project History

This section explains how to utilize the Project History feature to track changes, activities, and updates within a project in the system. It covers the steps to view, interpret, and manage project activity logs effectively.

## Accessing the Project History

1. **Navigate to the Project Dashboard**
   - Log into the application.
   - From the main menu, select **Projects**.
   - Choose the specific project you wish to review.
   - On the project overview page, locate the **History** or **Activity Log** tab or linkâ€”this is typically labeled as **Project History**.

2. **Open the Project History Section**
   - Click on the **Project History** tab.
   - The system loads a chronological list of all activities, changes, and updates related to the project.

## Understanding the Activity Log

The activity log displays entries with the following typical details:

- **Timestamp**: When the activity occurred.
- **User**: Who performed the activity.
- **Activity Type**: The nature of the change (e.g., created, updated, deleted, commented).
- **Description**: A brief summary of the activity.
- **Affected Items**: The specific test cases, milestones, or configurations impacted.

### Example of Log Entries

## Filtering and Searching Activities

To locate specific activities:

1. **Use Search Bar**
   - Enter keywords such as user names, activity types, or item names.
   - Press **Enter** or click the **Search** icon.

2. **Apply Filters**
   - Use available filters such as date range, activity type, or user.
   - Select the desired criteria and click **Apply Filters**.

3. **Clear Filters**
   - To reset filters, click **Clear Filters** or refresh the page.

## Interpreting Change Details

- Click on individual log entries for detailed information.
- View change history, including previous and new values for updated items.
- Some entries may include links to the affected items for quick navigation.

## Exporting Project Activity

1. **Download Activity Log**
   - Locate the **Export** button (often labeled as **Download Log** or similar).
   - Choose the preferred format (CSV, PDF, XLSX).
   - Confirm download to save the activity report locally.

2. **Print Activity Log**
   - Use the **Print** option to generate a physical copy or save as PDF via the print dialog.

## Managing Activity Records

- **Archiving**: Some systems allow archiving old activity logs to declutter the view.
- **Deletion**: Typically, activity logs are read-only; deletion may require admin privileges.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to view or export logs.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review project activity to monitor progress and identify issues.
- Use filters to focus on relevant activities during audits or reviews.
- Export logs periodically for record-keeping or compliance purposes.

## Tips

- For large projects with extensive activity, use date filters to narrow down recent activities.
- Utilize search keywords to find activities related to specific test cases or milestones.
- Keep logs secure; avoid sharing exported activity reports with unauthorized personnel.

By following these steps, you can effectively track, interpret, and manage project activities, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the project lifecycle.
