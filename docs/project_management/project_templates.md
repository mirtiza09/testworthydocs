# Project Templates

This section explains how to leverage project templates within the system to streamline the setup process for new projects. Templates serve as predefined blueprints that include configurations, test suites, milestones, and other project settings, enabling rapid deployment without manual configuration each time.

## Accessing Project Templates

1. **Navigate to the Project Management Section**
   - Log into the application.
   - From the main dashboard, locate the sidebar or top menu.
   - Click on **Projects** or **Project Management**.

2. **Open the Templates Area**
   - Within the Projects section, look for a tab or submenu labeled **Templates**.
   - Click on **Templates** to view existing project templates.

## Creating a New Project from a Template

1. **Initiate Project Creation**
   - Click on the **Create New Project** button.
   - A modal or form will appear prompting for project details.

2. **Select a Template**
   - In the project creation form, locate the **Template** dropdown or selection area.
   - Click to expand the list of available templates.
   - Choose an existing template that best matches your project needs.

3. **Configure Basic Project Details**
   - Fill in project-specific information such as:
     - Project Name
     - Description
     - Start and End Dates
     - Assigned Team Members

4. **Finalize Creation**
   - Confirm the template selection.
   - Click **Create** or **Save** to generate the project.
   - The system will clone the selected templateâ€™s configurations, test suites, milestones, and other settings into the new project.

## Using a Template for Rapid Setup

- **Template Selection During Project Creation**
  - When creating a new project, always choose a relevant template to auto-populate configurations.
- **Template Management**
  - To modify existing templates:
    - Go to **Templates** area.
    - Select the template to edit.
    - Make necessary changes (add/remove test suites, update milestones).
    - Save the template for future use.

## Best Practices

- **Maintain Up-to-Date Templates**
  - Regularly update templates to reflect best practices and latest configurations.
- **Create Templates for Common Project Types**
  - Develop templates for recurring project types to ensure consistency.
- **Limit Template Modifications**
  - Use versioning or naming conventions to track template updates and prevent accidental overwrites.

## Implementation Details

- Templates are stored as special project configurations marked as templates.
- When a project is created from a template, the system performs a deep copy of all associated entities:
  - Test Suites
  - Milestones
  - Test Cases
  - Settings and Permissions
- The cloning process ensures that the new project is independent of the template, allowing modifications without affecting the original template.

## Summary

Using project templates accelerates project setup by reusing predefined configurations. Always select the appropriate template during project creation, keep templates updated, and manage them centrally for consistency across projects.

*Tip:* To create a new template, set up a project with desired configurations, then mark it as a template in the project settings area. This template will then be available for future project creation.
