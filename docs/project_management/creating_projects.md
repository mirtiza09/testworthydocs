# Creating Projects

This section provides detailed instructions on how to create and configure new test projects within the system. It guides developers through the process of setting up a project, defining its parameters, and configuring essential settings to ensure proper integration and functionality.

## Step 1: Access the Project Management Interface

- Log into the system with appropriate permissions.
- Navigate to the **Project Management** section from the main dashboard.
- Click on the **Create New Project** button, typically located at the top right corner of the projects list.

## Step 2: Fill in Basic Project Details

- Enter a **Project Name** that clearly identifies the project scope.
- Provide a **Description** to outline the project's objectives and scope.
- Select the **Project Type** from available options (e.g., Test Management, Automation, etc.).
- Assign a **Project Leader** by selecting a user from the dropdown list.

## Step 3: Configure Project Settings

- **Set the Project Status** (Active, Inactive, Archived).
- Choose the **Default Language** for the project interface.
- Define the **Start Date** and **End Date** for the project timeline.
- Enable or disable **Notifications** for project updates.

## Step 4: Assign Users and Roles

- Add team members by selecting users from the user list.
- Assign roles such as **Tester**, **Developer**, **QA Lead**, or **Admin**.
- Configure role-specific permissions if custom roles are enabled.

## Step 5: Configure Project-Specific Parameters

- **Integrations**:
  - Link external tools such as Jira, TestRail, or Azure DevOps by entering API keys or URLs.
  - Enable integrations by toggling the respective switches.
- **Test Data Management**:
  - Define test data repositories or upload initial test data files.
  - Set data refresh schedules if applicable.
- **Custom Fields**:
  - Add custom fields relevant to your project (e.g., Priority, Severity).
  - Map custom fields to existing data models.

## Step 6: Set Up Test Suites and Milestones

- Create initial **Test Suites** to organize test cases.
- Define **Milestones** to track progress against key deliverables.
- Link test suites and milestones to the project during creation or afterward.

## Step 7: Configure Access and Permissions

- Set project visibility (Public or Private).
- Define access levels for different user groups.
- Enable or disable features such as test case editing, result logging, or reporting.

## Step 8: Save and Initialize the Project

- Review all entered details.
- Click **Save** to create the project.
- Upon creation, the system may prompt to initialize default test cases or import existing data.

## Additional Configuration (Optional)

- **Notification Settings**:
  - Configure email alerts for test execution, failures, or milestone achievements.
- **Reporting**:
  - Set up report templates and export options.
- **Automation Scripts**:
  - Upload or link automation scripts for continuous testing.

## Important Tips

- Ensure that external tool API keys are valid and have the necessary permissions.
- Use descriptive project names for easier management.
- Regularly update project settings as the project evolves.
- Assign appropriate roles to team members to control access and editing rights.

By following these steps, developers can efficiently create and configure new projects tailored to their testing and management needs, ensuring seamless integration and effective collaboration within the system.
