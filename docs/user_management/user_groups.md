# User Groups

This section guides you through the process of creating, editing, and managing user groups within the application to streamline permission assignment and improve user management efficiency.

## Accessing User Groups Management

1. Log in to the application with an account that has administrative privileges.
2. From the main dashboard, navigate to the **User Management** section.
3. Locate and click on **User Groups** in the sidebar or menu. This will open the User Groups management interface.

## Creating a New User Group

1. In the User Groups page, click the **Create New Group** button (often labeled as "Add Group" or with a "+" icon).
2. Fill in the following details in the form:
   - **Group Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the group (e.g., "QA Team", "Developers").
   - **Description**: Provide an optional description to clarify the group's purpose.
3. Assign permissions:
   - Select the permissions or roles that should be associated with this group.
   - Use checkboxes or toggle switches to enable or disable specific permissions.
4. Save the group:
   - Click the **Save** or **Create** button to finalize the creation.
   - The new group will now appear in the list of user groups.

## Managing Existing User Groups

1. From the User Groups list, locate the group you want to edit.
2. Click the **Edit** button (usually represented by a pencil icon) next to the group.
3. Modify the group details:
   - Change the group name or description as needed.
   - Adjust permissions by toggling checkboxes or selecting/deselecting roles.
4. Save changes:
   - Click **Update** or **Save** to apply modifications.
5. To delete a group:
   - Click the **Delete** button (often a trash bin icon).
   - Confirm the deletion when prompted. Be cautious, as this may affect users assigned to this group.

## Assigning Users to Groups

1. Navigate to the **User Management** section.
2. Select a user from the user list.
3. Click **Edit** or **Manage Roles**.
4. In the userâ€™s role assignment interface:
   - Select the appropriate user group(s) from a dropdown or multi-select list.
   - Confirm and save the changes.
5. Users assigned to a group inherit the permissions associated with that group.

## Best Practices

- Create groups based on roles or teams to simplify permission management.
- Regularly review group permissions to ensure they align with current organizational policies.
- Use descriptive group names and detailed descriptions for clarity.
- Limit the number of permissions assigned to each group to adhere to the principle of least privilege.

## Tips

- Use the **Search** feature within the User Groups list to quickly locate specific groups.
- Export the list of user groups for documentation or auditing purposes if supported.
- Combine groups with individual user permissions for granular control.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage user permissions through groups, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring consistent access control across your organization.
