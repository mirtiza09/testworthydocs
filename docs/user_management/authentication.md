# Authentication

This section covers the key functionalities related to user authentication within the application, including password policies, single sign-on configurations, and Active Directory integration. These features enable secure user access, streamline login processes, and support enterprise authentication standards.

## Setting Password Policies and Managing User Passwords

To establish and enforce password policies:

1. **Configure Password Requirements:**
   - Define minimum length, complexity, and expiration policies in the application's configuration or database settings.
   - Example: Set minimum password length to 8 characters, require uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

2. **Password Management Workflow:**
   - When a user creates or updates their password, validate against the policies.
   - Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms with salts (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2).
   - Example: When a user resets their password, generate a new hash and update the user record.

3. **Password Reset and Change:**
   - Provide a "Forgot Password" feature:
     - User requests password reset.
     - Generate a secure token with expiration.
     - Send email with reset link containing token.
   - Upon token validation, allow user to set a new password.

4. **Implementation Snippet:**
   - Pseudocode for password update:
     ```
     if (newPassword meets policies) {
       hashedPassword = hash(newPassword + salt);
       save hashedPassword to user record;
     }
     ```

**Tip:** Always enforce password policies server-side to prevent weak passwords and store only hashed passwords with salts.

## Configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) with Various Identity Providers

To enable SSO:

1. **Setup Identity Provider (IdP):**
   - Register your application with providers like Azure AD, Okta, Google, or other SAML/OAuth providers.
   - Obtain client IDs, secrets, and redirect URLs.

2. **Configure Application for SSO:**
   - In the application's admin panel or configuration files, input IdP credentials:
     - Client ID
     - Client Secret
     - Redirect URI
     - Scopes and endpoints

3. **Implement Authentication Flow:**
   - Redirect users to IdP login page.
   - Upon successful login, IdP redirects back with an authorization code.
   - Exchange code for access token and user info.
   - Map external user info to internal user records.

4. **Example Flow:**
   ```
   User clicks "Login with SSO"
   -> Redirect to IdP login URL
   -> User authenticates
   -> IdP redirects back with code
   -> Application exchanges code for token
   -> Retrieve user profile
   -> Authenticate or create user in local database
   ```

**Tip:** Use libraries like OAuth2 client, OpenID Connect SDKs, or middleware support for your framework to simplify implementation.

## Setting Up and Managing Active Directory Authentication

To integrate Active Directory (AD):

1. **Configure AD Connection:**
   - Set LDAP server URL, domain, and credentials in the application's configuration.
   - Example:
     ```
     LDAP_URL=ldap://ad.company.com
     DOMAIN=company.com
     ```

2. **Implement Authentication Logic:**
   - When a user attempts login:
     - Bind to LDAP with provided username and password.
     - Verify credentials against AD.
     - Retrieve user attributes (e.g., email, display name).

3. **Map AD Users to Application Users:**
   - On successful LDAP bind:
     - Check if user exists in local database.
     - If not, create a new user record with details from AD.
     - Assign roles and permissions based on AD groups if needed.

4. **Example LDAP Authentication Snippet:**
   ```
   ldap.bind(username, password, function(err) {
     if (err) { reject; }
     else { resolve; }
   });
   ```

**Tip:** Use LDAP libraries compatible with your backend framework (e.g., System.DirectoryServices in .NET, ldap3 in Python).

---

**Summary of Workflow:**

- Users can set or reset passwords following defined policies.
- Implement secure hashing and storage for passwords.
- Enable SSO by configuring external IdPs and handling OAuth/SAML flows.
- Integrate Active Directory by connecting via LDAP, authenticating users, and mapping AD groups/attributes.

**Remember:** Always prioritize securityâ€”use HTTPS, secure tokens, and adhere to best practices for password storage and external authentication integrations.
