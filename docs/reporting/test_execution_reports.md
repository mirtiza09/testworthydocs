# Test Execution Reports

This section guides developers on how to utilize and extend the test execution reporting features within the application. It covers how to access test execution progress and results, interpret report data, and implement customizations or integrations related to test reports.

## Accessing Test Execution Reports

To view test execution reports:

1. Log into the application with appropriate user credentials.
2. Navigate to the **Reports** section from the main menu.
3. Select **Test Execution Reports** from the submenu or dashboard options.

Alternatively, direct URLs or API endpoints may be configured for report access, depending on your deployment.

## Generating Test Reports

Test reports are typically generated based on the execution data stored in the database. To generate or refresh reports:

1. Ensure that test execution data (test runs, results, statuses) are up-to-date.
2. Use the **Generate Report** button or trigger the report generation API if available.
3. For automated report creation, configure scheduled jobs (e.g., via Hangfire or similar) to run report generation scripts at specified intervals.

## Viewing Test Execution Progress

Once reports are generated:

- Reports display progress bars indicating the percentage of test cases executed versus planned.
- Use filters to view specific test plans, milestones, or project segments.
- Progress data is dynamically fetched from the database, reflecting real-time execution status.

## Interpreting Test Results

Test results are presented in tabular and graphical formats:

- **Status Summary**: Shows counts of passed, failed, blocked, skipped, and not executed test cases.
- **Trend Graphs**: Visualize execution over time or across different test suites.
- **Detailed Results**: Click on individual test cases or test runs for detailed logs, defect links, and screenshots.

## Customizing Reports

Developers can extend or customize report layouts and data:

1. Modify report templates in the reporting module (e.g., using embedded reporting tools or custom HTML templates).
2. Add new filters or data points by extending the report data retrieval logic.
3. Integrate external reporting tools or dashboards via APIs.

## Exporting Reports

To export reports:

1. Use the **Export** button available on report pages.
2. Choose formats such as PDF, Excel, or CSV.
3. For automated exports, invoke the report export API with desired parameters.

**Note:** Ensure that the report generation service (e.g., Rotativa for PDF rendering) is configured correctly in your environment.

## Automating Test Reports

For continuous integration or scheduled reporting:

1. Configure scheduled tasks (e.g., using Hangfire or cron jobs) to trigger report generation scripts.
2. Use API endpoints to generate and retrieve reports programmatically.
3. Save or email reports automatically upon completion.

## Troubleshooting

- If reports are not updating, verify that test execution data is correctly stored and that report generation jobs are running.
- Check logs for errors related to report templates, rendering engines, or data retrieval.
- Ensure that dependencies like Rotativa or PDF rendering tools are properly installed and configured.

## Additional Tips

- Use filtering options to focus on specific test cycles or milestones.
- Customize report templates for branding or specific data presentation needs.
- Integrate report exports with external dashboards or BI tools for advanced analytics.
