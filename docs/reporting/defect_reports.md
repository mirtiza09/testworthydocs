# Defect Reports

This section explains how to view and interpret defect trend reports and defect status dashboards within the application. It guides you through accessing defect reports, understanding the displayed data, and utilizing the available features to analyze defect metrics effectively.

## Accessing Defect Reports

1. Log into the application with your user credentials.
2. From the main navigation menu, locate the **Reporting** section.
3. Click on **Defect Reports** to open the defect trend and status dashboards.

## Viewing Defect Trend Reports

The defect trend report provides a visual overview of defect occurrences over a specified period, helping identify patterns and areas requiring attention.

### Steps to Generate and View Defect Trend

1. In the defect reports page, select the desired **Time Range**:
   - Use the date picker controls to specify start and end dates.
2. Choose relevant filters:
   - **Project**: Select the specific project or all projects.
   - **Test Cycle**: Filter by test cycles if applicable.
   - **Defect Status**: Filter by defect statuses such as Open, In Progress, Closed.
3. Click the **Generate Report** button.
4. The report will render as a line or bar chart showing defect counts over time.

### Understanding the Chart

- **X-axis**: Represents the timeline based on the selected date range.
- **Y-axis**: Shows the number of defects.
- **Series**: Different lines/bars may represent defect statuses or categories.
- **Insights**:
  - Identify peaks indicating defect spikes.
  - Detect trends such as decreasing defect counts over time.

## Viewing Defect Status Dashboard

The defect status dashboard provides a snapshot of current defect distribution across various statuses and categories.

### Steps to Access and Use

1. From the defect reports page, select the **Status Dashboard** tab.
2. Apply filters if needed:
   - **Project**, **Test Suite**, **Severity**, **Assigned To**.
3. Click **Apply Filters**.
4. The dashboard displays:
   - Pie charts or donut charts showing defect proportions per status.
   - Tables listing defects with details like ID, summary, severity, assigned user, and current status.
   - Heatmaps or grid views for quick identification of defect density.

### Interpreting the Dashboard

- **High percentage of Open defects** indicates areas needing immediate attention.
- **Closed defect counts** help measure testing progress.
- **Distribution across categories** assists in prioritization.

## Exporting Reports

1. Use the **Export** button to download the current report in formats such as PDF, Excel, or CSV.
2. Choose the desired format and save the file locally for further analysis.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review defect trend reports to monitor defect resolution progress.
- Use the status dashboard to prioritize defects based on severity and current status.
- Customize filters to focus on specific projects, test cycles, or defect types.
- Export reports periodically for stakeholder updates.

## Additional Tips

- Save custom filter configurations for quick access in future sessions.
- Use the date range presets (e.g., last 7 days, last month) for rapid analysis.
- Combine defect reports with test execution data for comprehensive quality insights.

This guide ensures you can effectively utilize defect trend and status reports to maintain high-quality standards and facilitate defect management processes.
