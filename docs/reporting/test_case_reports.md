# Test Case Reports

This section explains how to generate, view, and interpret test case reports within the system. These reports provide insights into test case coverage, execution status, and overall quality metrics. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to access and utilize test case reports effectively.

## Accessing Test Case Reports

1. **Login to the Application**  
   - Enter your credentials on the login page and authenticate successfully.

2. **Navigate to the Reports Section**  
   - From the main dashboard or sidebar menu, locate and click on the **Reporting** menu item.
   - Within the Reporting menu, select **Test Case Reports**.

3. **Select the Desired Test Suite or Project**  
   - Use the dropdowns or filters to choose the specific project or test suite you want to analyze.
   - You can filter by date ranges, milestones, or specific test case categories if available.

## Generating a Test Case Coverage Report

1. **Configure Report Parameters**  
   - Choose filters such as:
     - Test suite or project
     - Test case status (Passed, Failed, Blocked, etc.)
     - Date range for execution
     - Milestones or specific test runs
   - Adjust additional filters like priority, assigned tester, or custom tags if supported.

2. **Run the Report**  
   - Click the **Generate Report** button.
   - The system will process the filters and compile the report data.

3. **View the Report**  
   - The report will display as a table or chart, showing:
     - Total test cases
     - Coverage percentage
     - Status distribution (e.g., number of Passed, Failed, Blocked)
     - Trends over time if date filters are used

4. **Export the Report**  
   - Use available options to export:
     - Download as PDF or Excel for offline analysis
     - Share via email or link if supported

## Interpreting Test Case Reports

- **Coverage Percentage**:  
  Indicates the proportion of test cases executed versus planned. Higher coverage suggests thorough testing.

- **Status Distribution**:  
  Review the counts of Passed, Failed, Blocked, or Not Executed cases to assess test health.

- **Trend Analysis**:  
  Observe changes over time to identify improvements or regressions in test coverage.

- **Detailed View**:  
  Click on individual entries or segments to drill down into specific test cases, their execution history, and defect links.

## Additional Tips

- **Custom Reports**:  
  Use saved filters or custom queries to generate recurring reports quickly.

- **Schedule Reports**:  
  If available, set up automated report generation for regular updates.

- **Review Failures**:  
  Focus on failed or blocked test cases to prioritize defect fixing.

- **Utilize Charts**:  
  Leverage visual charts for quick comprehension of coverage and status distribution.

## Implementation Details

- The reports are generated based on stored test execution data, linked to test cases, milestones, and test runs.
- Filters are applied via dropdowns and date pickers, which trigger backend queries to fetch relevant data.
- The report view supports exporting and printing, ensuring easy sharing and documentation.
- The system maintains historical data, enabling trend analysis over multiple test cycles.

## Summary

By following these steps, you can effectively generate and analyze test case reports to monitor testing progress, identify coverage gaps, and prioritize defect resolution. Regular review of these reports helps ensure comprehensive testing and high-quality releases.
